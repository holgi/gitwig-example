a gitwig example blog post
==========================

This is just an example of a new blog post in your inbox. If you want to post all the files in your inbox folder just issue a `gitwig-inbox` command. This will add all the missing header fields, move the blog posts and mediafiles to the right location and can automagically push the changes to the `hub` repository.
